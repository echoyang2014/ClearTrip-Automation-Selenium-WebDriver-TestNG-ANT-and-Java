# ClearTrip-Automation-Using-Selenium

This project is to write automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, ANT to build an automation framework for the website http://www.cleartrip.com

All test scripts are located under src/ folder

To run the project, I have created 1. Suite1_Flights.xml - TestNG xml file to run first suite
                                   2. Suite2_Hotels.xml - TestNG xml file to run second suite
                                   3. testng.xml - this xml will run entire suite
                                   4. run.bat - Using ANT, this file will run entire framework and will create report generation
                                   
The primary focus for this project is to learn more about how we can build an automation framework using Selenium, TestNG or JUnit and Apache ANT for building Java applications and overall framework report generation of test scripts.
